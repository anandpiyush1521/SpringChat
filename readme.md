# SPRINGCHAT - Spring Boot Chat Application with WebSocket

This project is a chat application built using Spring Boot and WebSocket. It allows real-time communication between clients and the server.

## Dependencies Used
- Lombok
- WebSocket
- Spring Web

## WebSocket

WebSocket is a communication protocol that provides full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. It offers several advantages over traditional HTTP communication:

### Advantages of WebSocket
1. **Real-time Data Transfer:** WebSocket enables real-time data transfer between clients and servers.
2. **Bi-Directional Communication:** Unlike HTTP, WebSocket allows communication to be initiated by both clients and servers.
3. **Efficiency:** WebSocket doesn't require headers for every message, making it more efficient than HTTP.
4. **Persistent Connection:** WebSocket maintains a persistent connection between the client and server, reducing latency in data transfer.

### Use Cases for WebSocket
1. **Chat Application:** WebSocket is ideal for building real-time chat applications.
2. **Real-time Gaming:** It can be used for real-time multiplayer gaming.
3. **Collaborative Editing:** WebSocket facilitates real-time collaboration in editing documents or code.
4. **Live Updates:** Websites or applications requiring live updates benefit from WebSocket.
5. **Internet of Things (IoT):** WebSocket allows IoT devices to send real-time updates to servers, which can then push these updates to end-users.
